# Introduction
Please clone this template to push your weekly lab assignments to GIT classroom. 
Weekly Lab assignments will be posted on Blackboard. 

# Naming Conventions
Weekly Lab submissions must be structured as:
 - LabNN (where NN must be replaced with the respective Lab number. For instanace, Lab01, Lab02, and so on).
 - This will enable you to segment each week's work in respective folders, while still maintaining a single GIT.
 - Please ensure that folder structur is maintained properly (otherwise it won't be graded).
 - Additionally, each week's submission must also contain:
  - [x] **Required solution** based on the lab instructions (for instance, screenshot, configurations, commands. etc.)
  - [x] **ReadME.MD** (To document/answer the questions)

 - Project Report (30%)
  - **Regular submission:** Before the next lab 0900 hrs.
  - **Delayed submission:** Before the end of next working week 1600 hrs (otherwise it won't be graded).
